## Navigation
#### About Us & FIRST
The "About Us" section should contain an updated list of all of the current members and staff of the club, in the form of photo + role + bio. "About FIRST" is a short description of the robotics program to promote FIRST.
#### Current Events
This will (hopefully) become a blog of sorts for the team. It'll keep everyone interested in the progress of our club. This should be updated regularly.
#### Contact
This section shouldn't change much, unless we get new social media accounts, or Venice relocates to a different place in town.

## Planned Additions
#### Archives
We will keep everything from a list of old members (Hall of Fame/Shame) to newspaper clippings.
