                        <p>I’ve always been interested in robotics. I joined in 10th grade and now I am co-president of this very club. This club is truly fascinating and I love coming every day to work on the robot. It is also fun to teach the “newbies” so that, next year, they can do their own robot. The challenges are interesting and being part of this is very worthwhile.</p>

                        <p>Due to the fact that I am a huge nerd and I love(d) programming, I joined robotics in 10th grade. I have a huge passion for anything science (maybe not biology), so robotics is something I look forward to every week. Being in the club has only added to my desire to study computer science in college.
Robotics is life.</p>

                        <p>I joined robotics for a single reason: I love designing things. One day I wish to use robotics to build prosthetics, and so joining robotics was common sense. I look forward to robotics every week because I am able to work with a team to design and build robots. Because of my experience with robotics, my desire to build prosthetics has been strengthened. #robotics<3bae<3

                        <p>I am currently a 10th grader in Venice High School. In Venice, I attend various clubs, but my favorite one, and the one I’m most dedicated to, is the Venice Robotics Club. When I was an eighth grader, my brother, who was senior at the time, joined robotics and liked it so much that at the end of the year he encouraged to join the club and become a programmer. Two years later, I’m a vice president and programmer in the club, and expect to stay until my senior year. My favorite movies are Star Wars, I like to surf and play airsoft, and I want to get a computer science and engineering degree.</p>

                        <p>Robotics fosters my love for science and technology. I joined the club last year because I saw a presentation at the STEMM Magnet Orientation. It was love at first sight. I want to be a clinical neuroscientist, and my acquired knowledge and enthusiasm for engineering will help me going forward. I’m a super nerd who loves Doctor Who and anime, so robotics was the perfect environment for me. I love my family here. <3

        <p>FIRST was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. FIRST designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.</p>
        <p>FIRST has not only inspired youth to pursue math, science, and technology fields but it has provided our future generation with a stepping stone to a greater future. Since its foundation in 1989 by inventor and robotics advocate, Dean Kamen and co-founder Woody Flowers, FIRST has continued to grow and build a gateway to a technology based future. Students learn marketing, team cooperation, and gracious professionalism. With the long hours, frustrations, and accomplishments students become independent and are soon ready to start off on their own to create a future not only for themselves but everyone they meet.</p>
        <p>The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is a mid-level robotics competition for high-school students. FTC presents a challenging obstacle but with a more accessible and affordable robotics kit. The ultimate goal of FTC is to reach more young people with a lower-cost, more accessible opportunity to discover the excitement and rewards of science, technology, and engineering.</p>
